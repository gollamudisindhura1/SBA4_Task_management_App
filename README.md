# Task Management App

## Overview

This is my Task Planner project created for my SBA. My app Uses JavaScript with DOM manipulation, localStorage for persistence, and event listeners for interactivity. 

I used array methods like push, and filter to manage data. The render() function is the core it updates the UI whenever the data changes.

It helps users to add, view, and update taska. you can set a deadline, choose a category, and mark the task as In Progress, Completed, or Overdue.

Tasks are selected with click, and deleted only after confirmation

## Features
- Add new tasks with:
      - Task name
      - Category
      - Deadline
      - Status
- The task marks as Overdue automatically when the deadline passes
- We can filter the tasks by the status or category
- We can update the task by using the dropdown

## Learnings

While working on the project, I have learned
- How to use arrays and objects in JavaScript to store data
- How to manipulate the DOM (add, update, and filter       elements on a web page)
- The importance of functions and event listeners

## Reflection
### Chanllenges Faced
- I found it tricky to get the filter feature and Overdue is not working correctly. It took time for me to understand how to compare dates and update the tasks list. How to update and save data in local storage was confusing.

### How I solved it
- I broke the problem into smaller steps and tested and checked if it is working after every change. I have used MDN and w3 schools and code camp to under them properly.

### If I had more time

I would have added more styling to the page.
